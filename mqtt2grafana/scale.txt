this repo is perfectly working ... gets started by running @start_real_meter_linx.sh which sets up .env and starts docker services 

As shown on main.py line 91, the program accepts ip_address and port for a smart meter and gets data from smart meter using ssl keys in certs folder. 

once data is received from the meter over SSL and wifi, it gets published to MQTT. then telegraph uses @telegraf.conf to write the data to influxDB. Finally grafana connects to influx db and visualizes real time data. 

now i WANT TO SCALE this pro
